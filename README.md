## Questions

1. Write a program to calculate average of `n` numbers. Create a function for that and use `*args` parameter to calculate the average. [*Solution*](/Solution/01-Average.py)
2. Write a program to determine whether a given number is prime of not. [*Solution*](/Solution/02-Prime-Check.py)
3. Write a program to create a list of 1st 50 prime numbers. [*Solution*](/Solution/03-Fifty-Prime-Numbers.py)
4. Write a program to calculate sum of both 1st 100 even and odd numbers. Create separate functions for that. [*Solution*](/Solution/04-Hundred-Even-Odd-Sum.py)
5. Create a class `Complex` to handle complex numbers of format `a + bi`. Use operator overloading for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division between these numbers. [*Solution*](/Solution/05-Complex-Numbers.py)
6. Create some classes name "Decimal" and "Binary". Write methods to do conversion from Decimal to Binary and vice versa. Follow these rules: [*Solution*](/Solution/06-Binary-Decimal.py)
> **Decimal:** Has base 10, contains digits in range 0 to 9.

> **Binary:** Has base 2, contains digits 0 and 1.
7. Create a simple Stone, Paper, Scissor game in console/terminal. You must use your own logic to check for win/lose/draw. You can use random module to create a basic AI opponent. [*Solution*](/Solution/07-Stone-Paper-Scissor.py)
8. Create a program to calculate area of different shapes such as **triangle**, **square**, **rectangle**, and **circle**. Create a class for each shape to hold basic information. Then, write method for each class to calculate area. All classes must be inherited from a base `Shape` class which contains a method for area calculation, which can be then override inside child classes. [*Solution*](/Solution/08-Area.py)
9. Create a program to print following basic patterns (inside their own functions, then print them all as following order):
 [*Solution*](/Solution/09-Patterns.py)
```
*****

10. Create a program to print the following pattern:
 [*Solution*](/Solution/10-Pattern-Window.py)
```
**********
*|======|*
*|=~~~~=|*
*|=¦××¦=|*
*|=¦××¦=|*
*|=<__>=|*
*|======|*
*|======|*
**********
```
